    Logical access level for which to return Zscaler Hub IP addresses.

    Must be either "required" or "recommended", where the "required" set of Zscaler Hub IP addresses
    is a proper subset of the "recommended" set of Zscaler Hub IP addresses when compared logically;
    i.e. {required} âŠ† {recommended}. The broader "recommended" access level affords more resiliency
    and scalability, whereas the narrower "required" access level minimizes exposure.

    Note:
      Zscaler Hub IP address ranges run vital Zscaler cloud services, platform management, and monitoring.
      Access to & from these IP addresses is essential for seamless service delivery and resilient and scalable support.
